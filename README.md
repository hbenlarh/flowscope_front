# FlowScope Frontend

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Done!** Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser

## What's New

- Pricing fields are now hidden from offer forms (backend still supports it as optional)
- Enhanced offer detail page with features, pros/cons, and screenshots
- Better admin and user offer management

## Note

The frontend connects to `http://localhost:8000` by default. Make sure the backend is running!
